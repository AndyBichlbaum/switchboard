ACTION SWITCHBOARD
===========

Yes Men's new human-staffed platform will give any user a way to plug directly into ongoing direct actions, 
or get lots of help starting new ones. It's a sort of match.com for social change, but with a human matchmaker to efficiently transform inspiration into action. 

It will provide some of the same functionality that was so central to the Occupy encampments: a space for folks who are interested in activism and direct action but haven't yet found an outlet or on ramp to get engaged. 

The technology itself will be relatively simple, but developing the platform will require extensive Drupal expertise, comfort with CiviCRM, and the ability to iterate plans creatively with strong user focus.
